    <!-- SACCO Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>What is a SACCO?</h2>
      <p>
        Savings and Credit Cooperative Organizations (SACCOs) are 
        member-owned financial institutions where people save 
        together and access affordable loans. They encourage a 
        culture of saving while providing members with affordable 
        credit options.
      </p>
      <h3>Examples in Kenya:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Safaricom Kona SACCO</li>
        <li>Stima SACCO</li>
        <li>Mwalimu SACCO</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Low-interest loans, collective saving power, 
        annual dividends.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- MMF Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Money Market Funds (MMFs)</h2>
      <p>
        MMFs are collective investment schemes where members pool 
        funds that are invested in safe, short-term assets such as 
        Treasury bills, commercial papers, and government securities. 
        They are low-risk and provide steady interest returns.
      </p>
      <h3>Popular MMFs in Kenya:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Britam Money Market Fund</li>
        <li>KCB M-Pesa (MMF option)</li>
        <li>Zidii Money Market Fund</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Liquidity (easy withdrawals), low risk, steady 
        returns (8–11% annually).</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Stocks Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Stocks & Investments</h2>
      <p>
        Buying shares in a company makes you a part-owner of that 
        business. Stocks can grow in value over time and may also 
        pay dividends. They are higher-risk compared to SACCOs and 
        MMFs but can bring higher returns.
      </p>
      <h3>Commonly Traded in Kenya:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Safaricom PLC</li>
        <li>Equity Bank</li>
        <li>KCB Group</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Potential for high returns, ownership in a 
        company, dividend payments.</p>
